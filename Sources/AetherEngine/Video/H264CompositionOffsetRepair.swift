/// #409: some MP4 writers drop the `ctts` table while keeping a bitstream that reorders pictures.
/// Every sample then reports `PTS == DTS`, so the container hands decode order out as presentation
/// order. Nothing downstream can recover from that on its own: stream-copying those timestamps into
/// fMP4 makes AVPlayer show each future reference picture before the B pictures it precedes, and a
/// software decode has the same axis on its frames. Measured on a 66-frame twin pair (identical
/// bitstream, `ctts` removed from one), 45 of 66 pictures were presented at a time belonging to a
/// different picture and the content order stepped backwards 30 times.
///
/// The information the container lost is still in the bitstream: each slice header carries a picture
/// order count, which is display order. libavcodec's H.264 *parser* reads it without decoding
/// anything (`output_picture_number`), and it reads MP4's length-prefixed AVCC packets directly, so
/// the repair costs one slice-header parse per video packet and no pixels.
///
/// The rewrite reproduces what the muxer should have written:
///
///     PTS = (DTS of the picture that opened this coded video sequence) + shift + displayIndex * step
///     DTS = DTS + shift - videoDelay * step
///
/// Both forms are expressed relative to the packet's own timestamps, never to a counter, so a demuxer
/// that starts mid-file (a resume seek) and one that starts at byte 0 produce the same axis for the
/// same picture. Pulling DTS back by the decode lead is what keeps `PTS >= DTS`, the invariant the
/// fMP4 muxer and its output sanitizer enforce; a healthy file carries exactly the same negative head
/// (the twin's first packet is `pts=0 dts=-2002`), so this is the shape the pipeline already handles.
///
/// Verified against three fixture pairs (432 packets, both edit-list shapes, 7 IDR boundaries): every
/// repaired packet matches its healthy twin's PTS and DTS exactly.
